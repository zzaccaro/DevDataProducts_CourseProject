Developing Data Products Course Project by Zach Zaccaro
=========================
Part of the Coursera Data Science specialization track.

Exploring the Storm Database
==================

This application uses data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

The data can be obtained [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to acquire a better understanding of **Shiny** for use in building data product applications and **R-Presentation** and **Slidify** for creating data product related presentations.

This particular application takes a look at fatalities and injuries caused by severe weather events across the United States from 1950 to 2011 and uncovers some interesting facts about how dangerous these events are and where they typically occur.

## How to Use

There are two other tabs besides this one named "By State" and "By Event."

If you click on the "By State" tab, you will see the top 5 weather events causing fatalities and injuries within the state chosen in the sidebar. Use the dropdown list to choose the state you would like to see, and the bar charts will change accordingly.

In the "By Event" tab, you will see two maps of the United States highlighting where certain events have caused the most fatalities/injuries. Use the checkboxes in the sidebar to see which states have been most affected (population-wise) by the particular weather event(s) selected.
